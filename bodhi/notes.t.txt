get & post requests are complete

before moving on: what possible put requests would I need?
To update a user's email, password, gender, last name and possibly even first name?
No DELETE requests. No DELETING ever happens.

I think for the signin and sign up page I don't need AJAX since I will be refeshing the page -___________- yesterday was a waste!
user stories:
the landing page's call to action is for the user to create an account. 
This CTA should be a prominent, brightly colored button.
