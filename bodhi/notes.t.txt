get & post requests are complete

before moving on: what possible put requests would I need?
To update a user's email, password, gender, last name and possibly even first name?
No DELETE requests. No DELETING ever happens.

I think for the signin and sign up page I don't need AJAX since I will be refeshing the page -___________- yesterday was a waste!
user stories:
the landing page's call to action is for the user to create an account. 
This CTA should be a prominent, brightly colored button.


Once a user signs up I think it is obvious to need a tutorial. I like matirealize's options for scroll fire so that as theylook upon the log the first time they are able to see helpful tips and how-to's.

The home page should show a viewers log. My inspriation is something like Mint only cleaner.
For this reason before the log is shown I have to work on my graphs! C3 here I come.
